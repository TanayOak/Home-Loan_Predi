# Home-Loan_Prediction

Due to Covid-19 ,a year full of financial loss, a lot of businesses have been going through a rough time financially. In order to help themselves out financially these businesses seek loan from banks.

Even though the banking sector has advanced in many ways, it has limited assets which can be given to limited people only. And the process to find out to whom the loan should be given is quite lengthy and tedious .

In order to make this process easy and more accurate, we can use machine learning to find an appropriate method to predict the eligibility to get a loan.

It is very difficult to predict the possibility of payment of loan by the customer. In recent years many researchers worked on loan approval prediction systems. Machine Learning techniques are very useful in predicting outcomes for large amount of data. 

So the main objective of this project is to find a appropriate algorithm using Machine Learning to predict whether a particular person meets the eligibility criteria in order to get the required home loan from bank.

# Conclusion

Hence the project predicts successfully about the approval of loan for an individual based on various of loan for an individual based on various characteristics such as income, credit history and many more. We also found that the most accurate model for prediction is that of Decision Tree which has the highest accuracy and precision.
